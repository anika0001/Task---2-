# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

This project is part of my internship at **Prodigy Infotech (June 2025)** under the Data Science domain.

---

### 📌 Objective:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### 🔎 Key Steps:
- Loaded the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`)
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`)
- Performed EDA with visualizations:
  - Survival distribution
  - Survival by gender and class
  - Age distribution
  - Correlation heatmap

---

### ✅ Insights:
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival
- Most passengers were aged between 20–40
